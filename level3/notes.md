## Objects Types
Key-value pairs in an object types can be notated the same as variables

function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });

this is how you would pass the object into a function


ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
